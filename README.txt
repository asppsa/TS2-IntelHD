FAQs
===========

* Why have you included a complex folder structure?

This resembles the structure of The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection, of which EA is upgrading everybody to, mainly so it can be installed easily; all you have to do is accept any folder merge and file replacement prompts. I'm not officially supporting older builds of the game but if you want it there that badly, install this to `<most recent EP/SP>\TSData\Res\Config\Graphics Rules.sgr`.

* Can I use this with any other GPU that's not part of the Intel HD Graphics family?

It should work fine, but this config was optimised specifically for Intel HD iGPUs.

* Will this work on the Mac?

At the time of writing, I don't know. It shouldn't be an issue as far as I'm aware but I don't have a Mac to test this with.

* Where do I install this to?

If you're using the Ultimate Collection, unzip this to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection`. If not, see above for install instructions.

* Why does my frame rate drop when I turn on Smooth Edges?

The Sims 2 uses MSAA to achieve this and it is very performance heavy. It fixes the weird texture flickering glitch when it's switched on but it comes at a performance cost. This is the unfortunate reality of APUs and MSAA. Pick your poison.

* What is backup.bat for?

This allows you to seamlessly backup your old/current Graphics Rules.sgr file. The backup will be placed in the same directory as where the new file should go. Note that this is only configured for The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection. restore.ba
t restores the previously made backup.

Please backup your original Graphics Rules.sgr before installing this.
